#+TITLE: Base64 encoding system using Client-Server socket programming
* Goals
(Set of goals; difficulty in brackets)

1. [-] Server C program
   1. [X] Receive and print message from client
      1. Might have to split the large message into parts and then send
        them one by one.
   2. [X] Structures for message type
      1. Properly parse the input 
   3. [X] Implement the looping (2)
   4. [ ] Decode message (1)
   5. [X] Concurrency (5)
   6. [X] Do cleanups (free the port?) at the end (2)
   7. [X] Command line input. (1)
   8. [X] Send Ack (1)

2. [-] Client C program
   1. [X] Send messages to the server
   2. [X] Ask reader for message type, followed by message (1)
   3. [ ] The input message should be encoded (1)
   4. [X] Structures message type
   5. [X] Wait for Ack (2)

3. General
   1. [ ] Base64 encoding (2)

      Note: Base64 encoding and decoding is fairly standard and code
      can be easily found in the internet!
   2. [ ] Base64 decoding (2)
   3. [ ] Use ~memset~ instead of ~bzero~, since the former function
      is deprecated. (2)
   4. [ ] Get rid of ~scanf~, since it can cause buffer overflows. (1)
   5. [X] When multiple connections are implemented, the client who
      sent the output should be identified. (2)
   6. [ ] +Function to print time+ (1)

      +Print this whenever some command gets executed!+

2. Server: ~./server.out~
3. Client: ~./client.out 127.0.0.1 5001~
